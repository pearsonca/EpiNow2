Forecasting also supported time-varying reproduction number, infections, reported cases using generative process approach used estimation. EpiNow2 estimates time-varying reproduction number cases date infection (using similar approach implemented {EpiEstim}). True infections, treated latent unobserved, estimated mapped observed data (example cases date report) via one delay distributions (examples package documentation incubation period reporting delay) reporting model can include weekly periodicity. Uncertainty propagated inputs final parameter estimates, helping mitigate spurious findings. handled internally. time-varying reproduction estimates uncertain generation time also give time-varying estimates rate growth. EpiNow2 provides three models: estimate_infections(): Reconstruct cases date infection reported cases. estimate_secondary(): Estimate relationship primary secondary observations, example, deaths (secondary) based hospital admissions (primary), bed occupancy (secondary) based hospital admissions (primary). estimate_truncation(): Estimate truncation distribution multiple snapshots data source time. flexibility, check {epinowcast} package. default model estimate_infections() uses non-stationary Gaussian process estimate time-varying reproduction number infer infections. options, generally reduce runtimes cost granularity estimates real-time performance, include: stationary Gaussian process (faster estimate currently gives reduced performance real time estimates). User specified breakpoints. fixed reproduction number. piecewise constant, combining fixed reproduction number breakpoints. random walk, combining fixed reproduction number regularly spaced breakpoints (.e weekly). deconvolution/back-calculation method inferring infections, followed calculating time-varying reproduction number. Adjustment remaining susceptible population beyond forecast horizon. default, models fit MCMC sampling using rstan R package backend.
